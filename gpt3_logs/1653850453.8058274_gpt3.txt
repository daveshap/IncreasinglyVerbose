Write a detailed summary of the following:

the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”  “I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”  “You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths; and the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.  “The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they _would_ go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”  “Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.”  “I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do you know why it’s called a whiting?”  “I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”  “_It does the boots and shoes_,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.  Alice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated in a wondering tone.  “Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what makes them so shiny?”  Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer. “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”  “Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, “are done with a whiting. Now you know.”  “And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.  “Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: “any shrimp could have told you that.”  “If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back, please: we don’t want _you_ with us!’”  “They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”  “Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.  “Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to _me_, and told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”  “Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.  “I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of _your_ adventures.”  “I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said Alice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.”  “Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.  “No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: “explanations take such a dreadful time.”  So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating “_You are old, Father William_,” to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”  “It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.  “It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.  “Stand up and repeat ‘’_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,’” said the Gryphon.  “How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!” thought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:—  “’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare, “You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.” As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Alice is talking to the Mock Turtle and Gryphon about her adventures. The Mock Turtle is particularly interested in the part where Alice repeats "You Are Old, Father William" to the Caterpillar, and the words come out different each time. The Gryphon says that Alice should repeat something for them now, and she agrees. However, she is so distracted by the Lobster Quadrille that she can hardly remember what she is saying. The Mock Turtle and Gryphon are both amused and perplexed by her performance.
