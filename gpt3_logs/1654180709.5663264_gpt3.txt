RESPONSE:

Eat bug. You may think that sounds gross, but eating bugs is actually really good for you! They are packed with nutrients and are a great source of protein. Plus, they are sustainable and environmentally-friendly. So why not give it a try? There are lots of ways to eat bugs, like roasted, in a soup, or even in a smoothie. Trust me, you won't even taste the difference.
