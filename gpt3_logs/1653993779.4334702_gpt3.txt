PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:

Alice is sitting on a riverbank with her sister, feeling bored and drowsy. She sees a white rabbit running by and, curiosity getting the better of her, follows it down a rabbit hole. She falls for a long time before landing in a strange hall with many doors. She finds a key to fit one of the doors, but when she unlocks it, she finds only a tiny door too small for her to fit through. She then finds a cake with “EAT ME” written on it and, after eating a piece, shrinks until she can fit through the tiny door. On the other side is a beautiful garden, but she is soon confronted by a large, angry-looking cat. She escapes by climbing a tree.  Alice falls down a rabbit hole and finds herself in a long, dark tunnel. She eventually comes to a small door and uses a key to unlock it. The door leads to a small passage, which Alice follows until she comes to a small room. The room is empty except for a table and a chair, and on the table is a small golden key. Alice pocketed the key and then explored the rest of the room, eventually finding a door that was too small for her to fit through. She tried the key in the lock and found that it fit, so she opened the door and squeezed through.  Alice is in a dark hall, longing to get into a beautiful garden she can see through a doorway. She tries to get her head through the doorway, but she's too big. She wishes she could shrink like a telescope. Alice finds a key and a little bottle on a table. The bottle is labeled "DRINK ME," soAlice drinks some of the contents. Suddenly, she shrinks! She's now the right size to go through the doorway into the garden. First, she waits to see if she'll shrink any further. Then she goes into the garden and has a wonderful time. She eventually falls asleep. When Alice wakes up, she's back in the dark hall, and she's back to her original size. She can't find the key or the bottle. She starts to cry, but she scolds herself and decides to leave the dark hall.  Alice finds a cake with the words "EAT ME" written in currants and decides to eat it. She grows either larger or smaller, depending on how much she eats. She grows so large that her head hits the roof and she shrinks so small that her feet are almost out of sight. She tries to remember who she is and where she come from, but she can't. The White Rabbit returns and is surprised to see Alice. He drops his gloves and fan and runs away. Alice picks up the gloves and fan and continues to fan herself. She grows larger and larger until she is bigger than the house. She decides to go outside and shrinks down to a small size. She comes across a glass table with a tiny key on it. She picks up the key and unlocks the door to the garden.  Alice is swimming in a pool of her own tears, wondering how she got there, when she suddenly shrinks down to nine feet tall. She realizes that she must have been changed for Mabel, and that the only way to change back is to go and live in the poky little house. However, she decides that she would rather stay down here and be somebody else. She then finds a little door and a key, and tries to open the door, but it is too small. She shrinks down again and tries to open the door, but this time she is too big. She then hears someone coming, and hides behind a curtain.  Alice sees something splashing about in the pool and swims over to investigate. She finds it is only a mouse that has slipped in like herself. Alice wonders if it would be any use to speak to the mouse, and decides to try. She begins by asking the mouse if it knows the way out of the pool. The mouse looks at her inquisitively but says nothing. Alice wonders if the mouse doesn't understand English, and decides it must be a French mouse that came over with William the Conqueror. She tries again, this time in French, but the mouse only leaps out of the water in fright. Alice apologizes, saying she forgot the mouse didn't like cats. The mouse responds angrily, saying that its family has always hated cats. Alice hurriedly changes the subject, asking if the mouse is fond of dogs. The mouse doesn't answer, so Alice continues, telling the mouse about a nice little dog near her house. The mouse swims away in anger and Alice calls after it, promising not to talk about cats or dogs if the mouse comes back. The mouse swims back and agrees to tell Alice its story. The story turns out to be quite long, and by the time the mouse is finished, the pool is quite full of animals that have fallen in. Alice leads the way out and the whole party swims to shore.  Alice and the other animals are sitting on the bank, wet and uncomfortable. They discuss how to get dry again and Alice finds herself talking to them as if she has known them all her life. The Mouse, who seems to be in charge, tells them to sit down and be quiet while it dries them off. The Mouse starts reciting a long history, but the Lory interrupts, shivering. The Mouse scolds the Lory and continues reciting. The Duck interrupts, asking what the Mouse is talking about.
