Eat bug. Catching the bug is easy, simply put some food out and wait for it to come to you. Once you have your bug, you need to cook it.

Once it's cooked, you can either eat it yourself or sell it to someone else. Eating bugs is gross to some people, but others find them yummy. Bugs are also quite nutritious, so they make a great addition to any diet. If you're looking for a new and exciting way to spice up your meals, why not give bugs a try?
