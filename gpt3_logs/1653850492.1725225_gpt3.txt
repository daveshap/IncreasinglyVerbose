them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none of my own. I’m a hatter.”  Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.  “Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll have you executed on the spot.”  This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.  Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her.  “I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.” said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. “I can hardly breathe.”  “I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”  “You’ve no right to grow _here_,” said the Dormouse.  “Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing too.”  “Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in that ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.  All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!” on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.  “Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you executed, whether you’re nervous or not.”  “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, “—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”  “The twinkling of the _what?_” said the King.  “It _began_ with the tea,” the Hatter replied.  “Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply. “Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!”  “I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after that—only the March Hare said—”  “I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.  “You did!” said the Hatter.  “I deny it!” said the March Hare.  “He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”  “Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.  “After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”  “But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.  “That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.  “You _must_ remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”  The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.  “You’re a _very_ poor _speaker_,” said the King.  Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.)  “I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice. “I’ve so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court,” and I never understood what it meant till now.”  “If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the King.  “I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor, as it is.”  “Then you may _sit_ down,” the King replied.  Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.  “Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now we shall get on better.”  “I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of

RESPONSE:

The Hatter is on trial for allegedly murdering the March Hare. The Queen is presiding over the trial, and the Hatter is the only witness. The Hatter is extremely nervous, and he fumbles his way through his testimony. At one point, he even bites a piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter. Alice is sitting in the courtroom, and she begins to grow larger again. The Dormouse, who is sitting next to her, complains that Alice is squishing him. Alice and the Dormouse argue back and forth for a bit, until finally the Dormouse crosses over to the other side of the courtroom. The Hatter's testimony continues, and he eventually gets to the part where the Dormouse said something. However, the Hatter can't remember what the Dormouse said, and the King gets angry. The Hatter is about to be executed, when one of the guinea-pigs in the courtroom cheers. The guinea-pig is immediately suppressed by the court officers. Alice is surprised by this, and she thinks to herself that she's glad she finally understands what "attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court" means. The Hatter is allowed to sit down, and the trial proceeds. However, the second guinea-pig in the courtroom cheers, and he too is suppressed. Eventually, the Hatter finishes his testimony and the trial is over. Alice is relieved, and she thinks to herself that now they can get on better.
