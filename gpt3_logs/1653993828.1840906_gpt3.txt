doesn't know and the Queen gets angry, screaming for Alice's head. The King calms the Queen down and she asks the Knave to turn over the three gardeners lying on the ground. The gardeners are actually soldiers in disguise and the Queen orders their heads to be cut off. Alice protects the soldiers and puts them in a flower pot. The Queen asks Alice if she can play croquet and Alice responds that she can. The White Rabbit whispers to Alice that the Duchess is under sentence of execution.  Alice encounters a number of curious creatures while playing croquet with the Queen. Among them is the Cheshire Cat, who she strikes up a conversation with. The Cat tells Alice that the Queen is not playing fair and that she is likely to win the game. The Queen overhears this and becomes angry with Alice. The King then speaks to Alice, asking who she was talking to. Alice tells him it is a friend of hers, a Cheshire Cat.  Alice meets the King and Queen, who are arguing with the executioner about whether or not it is possible to behead something without a body. Alice is asked to settle the argument, and she suggests that they ask the Duchess, who is in prison. The executioner goes to fetch her, and while he is gone, the Cat's head disappears. The Duchess is in a good mood when she returns, and she and Alice walk off together. Alice reflects on how the Duchess was so savage when they first met in the kitchen, and wonders if it was the pepper that made her that way. The Duchess begins telling Alice a story about a Mock Turtle.  Alice is sitting with the Duchess, who is unpleasantly close to her and keeps digging her chin into Alice's shoulder. They discuss the moral of a story, and the Duchess insists that everything has a moral. Alice demurs, saying that some things may not have a moral. The Duchess then goes on to tell Alice that the moral of the story is that "it is love that makes the world go round." Alice replies that someone once said that it is actually done by everyone minding their own business. The Duchess agrees, saying that it is the same thing. The Duchess then asks Alice why she isn't putting her arm around Alice's waist, and Alice replies that she is afraid the Duchess's flamingo might bite her. The Duchess says that the moral of that is "birds of a feather flock together." Alice points out that mustard is not a bird, to which the Duchess replies that the moral of that is "the more there is of mine, the less there is of yours." Alice insists that mustard is actually a vegetable, and the Duchess agrees, saying that the moral of that is "be what you would seem to be." The Duchess then tells Alice that she is welcome to everything she has said so far, and Alice politely declines. The Duchess then says that if she wanted to, she could say much more. Alice is beginning to feel worried, and the Duchess's voice suddenly dies away in the middle of her sentence. Alice looks up and sees that the Duchess has turned into a pig.  Alice is playing croquet with the Queen when she is suddenly summoned to speak with her. The Queen is very angry and tells Alice that she must either leave or be put to death. Alice chooses to leave, and the Queen tells her to go see the Mock Turtle. Alice meets the Gryphon, who tells her that the Mock Turtle is very sad and has been crying. They go to see him and the Gryphon tells Alice that the Mock Turtle will tell her his story. The Mock Turtle tells Alice that he used to be a real turtle, but he is now just a mock turtle. He tells her about his life and how he became a mock turtle. Alice is very sympathetic and feels sorry for the Mock Turtle. She is also glad when the Gryphon tells her that executions are not really carried out in their world.  The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon are telling Alice about their schooling. The Mock Turtle explains that they went to school in the sea and that the master was an old Turtle called Tortoise. Alice is surprised that they would call him Tortoise if he wasn't one. The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon explain that he was called Tortoise because he taught them. They tell Alice that they had the best education and that they learned French and music. The Mock Turtle says that they also learned washing, but Alice is surprised that they would need to learn that at the bottom of the sea. The Mock Turtle explains that they couldn't afford to learn it. They tell Alice about the different subjects they learned, including reeling and writhing, arithmetic, and drawling. They also tell her about the Mystery and Seaography classes. When Alice asks about the eleventh day, the Mock Turtle tells her that it was a holiday.  The Lobster Quadrille is a dance performed by two lines of people, with each person having a lobster as their partner. The dance starts with everyone advancing twice and then changing partners. The new partners then swim out to sea as far as they can and back to land again. The dance ends with everyone changing partners again and retiring in the same order.
