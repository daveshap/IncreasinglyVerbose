Write a concise summary of the following:

The Mouse gets cross and tells the Duck to listen. The Mouse continues reciting, but Alice is still wet. The Dodo suddenly stands up and says they need to take more drastic measures. It suggests a Caucus-race, but no one knows what that is. The Dodo explains that they will all run around in a circle and whoever wants to can start and stop running whenever they want. They all start running and after a while the Dodo calls out that the race is over. They all crowd around, panting, and ask who won. The Dodo can't answer and they all go their separate ways.  Alice is sitting with the Dodo bird and a group of other animals, who are all waiting in silence. The Dodo suddenly speaks up, saying that everyone has won and deserves a prize. When asked who will give out the prizes, the Dodo points to Alice. Alice has no idea what to do, but she remembers she has a box of candy in her pocket. She hands out the candy as prizes, but the Dodo says she must have a prize herself. All Alice has is a thimble, which she reluctantly hands over. The next thing is to eat the candy, which causes some chaos as the larger birds can't taste theirs and the smaller ones start choking. Once that's over, they all sit down and the Mouse starts to tell them a story. Alice is only half paying attention, so her version of the story is very different from the Mouse's. The Mouse gets angry and walks away, leaving the others disappointed. Alice calls after it, begging it to come back and finish the story, but the Mouse only shakes its head and keeps walking.  Alice encounters a group of birds who are shocked to hear that her cat, Dinah, likes to eat them. They all fly away except for one old Magpie, who tells Alice that she must be getting home. Alice is left alone and feels sad that nobody likes Dinah. Soon, she hears the sound of footsteps and hopes it is the Mouse returning to finish his story. However, it is only the White Rabbit, who is looking for his fan and gloves. The Rabbit mistakes Alice for his housemaid and orders her to go fetch them. Alice decides to comply, hoping that she can find the Rabbit's fan and gloves while also looking for her own. She comes across a neat little house with a brass plate that reads "W. RABBIT" and goes inside. Alice finds the fan and gloves but also notices a bottle of liquid. She decides to drink it, hoping it will make her grow large again.  Alice finds herself in a room that is growing smaller as she drinks from a magic bottle. She soon realizes that she is in danger of being crushed and sticks her arm out the window and her foot up the chimney. Suddenly, the room stops shrinking. Alice then hears the voice of the Rabbit outside and realizes that it is coming for her. She tries to grab it, but only succeeds in knocking over a cucumber frame. The Rabbit is angry and tells Alice to go away. There is a long silence and then Alice hears whispers. She eventually falls asleep.  Alice is sitting by the window in a house when she sees a group of animals and birds outside. One of the animals, a little lizard called Bill, is in the middle of the group, being held up by two guinea pigs. The guinea pigs are giving Bill something out of a bottle. When Alice appears, the group rushes towards her, but she runs away and finds herself in a wood. Alice decides that the first thing she needs to do is find out what the animals and birds are doing. She comes across a small rabbit, who tells her that they are going to burn down the house. Alice is shocked and tells the rabbit that if they do, she will set her cat, Dinah, on them. The rabbit is silent for a moment before telling Alice that they need a barrowful of things to burn the house down. Alice decides to eat one of the cakes that the animals were throwing at her earlier. After eating it, she finds that she has shrunk in size. She is now small enough to fit through the door and runs out of the house. The animals and birds are gone when Alice exits the house. She sees Bill, the lizard, lying on the ground. She tries to give him some of the cake, but it turns into pebbles when she tries to break it. Alice picks up one of the pebbles and puts it in her pocket.  Alice is in a wood and she wants to get back to her original size and find her way into a lovely garden. She meets a puppy who is very large. The puppy is friendly and wants to play with Alice, but Alice is afraid that the puppy might be hungry and eat her. Alice tries to escape from the puppy, but it follows her. She runs until she is very tired and the puppy is far away. Alice then meets a caterpillar who is smoking a hookah. The caterpillar asks Alice who she is and Alice tells him that she doesn't really know. The caterpillar tells her that she needs to eat or drink something. Alice doesn't see anything that she thinks she should eat or drink. There is a mushroom near her and she decides to see if there is anything on top of it. When she looks over the edge of the mushroom, she sees the caterpillar. The
