PROMPT:

Write a detailed summary of the following:

very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be so stingy about it, you know—”  She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.”  “Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.  “Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only you can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as she spoke.  Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.  “The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little.  “’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love, ’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”  “Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding their own business!”  “Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of _that_ is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.’”  “How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to herself.  “I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,” the Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”  “He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried.  “Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”  “Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.  “Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of putting things!”  “It’s a mineral, I _think_,” said Alice.  “Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.’”  “Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”  “I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that is—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more simply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.’”  “I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely, “if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”  “That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.  “Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said Alice.  “Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a present of everything I’ve said as yet.”  “A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give birthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out loud.  “Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.  “I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried.  “Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and the m—”  But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Alice is sitting with the Duchess, who is unpleasantly close to her and keeps digging her chin into Alice's shoulder. They discuss the moral of a story, and the Duchess insists that everything has a moral. Alice demurs, saying that some things may not have a moral. The Duchess then goes on to tell Alice that the moral of the story is that "it is love that makes the world go round." Alice replies that someone once said that it is actually done by everyone minding their own business. The Duchess agrees, saying that it is the same thing. The Duchess then asks Alice why she isn't putting her arm around Alice's waist, and Alice replies that she is afraid the Duchess's flamingo might bite her. The Duchess says that the moral of that is "birds of a feather flock together." Alice points out that mustard is not a bird, to which the Duchess replies that the moral of that is "the more there is of mine, the less there is of yours." Alice insists that mustard is actually a vegetable, and the Duchess agrees, saying that the moral of that is "be what you would seem to be." The Duchess then tells Alice that she is welcome to everything she has said so far, and Alice politely declines. The Duchess then says that if she wanted to, she could say much more. Alice is beginning to feel worried, and the Duchess's voice suddenly dies away in the middle of her sentence. Alice looks up and sees that the Duchess has turned into a pig.
