Write a concise summary of the following:

Alice is talking to the Mock Turtle and Gryphon about her adventures. The Mock Turtle is particularly interested in the part where Alice repeats "You Are Old, Father William" to the Caterpillar, and the words come out different each time. The Gryphon says that Alice should repeat something for them now, and she agrees. However, she is so distracted by the Lobster Quadrille that she can hardly remember what she is saying. The Mock Turtle and Gryphon are both amused and perplexed by her performance.  Alice is sitting with the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle when the Mock Turtle asks about the rhyme Alice was just reciting. The Gryphon hastily tells the Mock Turtle to move on to the next verse, but the Mock Turtle persists, asking about the details of the rhyme. Alice tries to explain, but she is interrupted by the Gryphon, who tells her to move on to the next verse. The Mock Turtle then asks Alice to sing a song, and she gladly agrees. The Mock Turtle sings a beautiful song about soup, and at the end, the Gryphon and Alice hurry off, leaving the Mock Turtle behind. They arrive at a court where the King and Queen of Hearts are seated on their throne, with a crowd of animals and cards gathered around them. The Knave of Hearts is standing in chains in front of them, guarded by two soldiers, and near the King is the White Rabbit, holding a trumpet and a scroll of parchment. In the middle of the court is a table with a large dish of tarts on it. The tarts look so good that Alice is tempted to take one, but she is stopped by the Gryphon, who tells her that the tarts are for the Queen's birthday party and she will be in big trouble if she takes one.  Alice is sitting in a courtroom, waiting for the trial to begin. She is curious about everything in the room and tries to guess what each thing is. She correctly identifies the judge and the jury box, but is unsure about what the twelve creatures in the jury box are. She eventually decides they must be the jurors. The jurors are all writing busily on their slates. Alice is curious about what they could be writing and asks the Gryphon. He tells her they are writing down their names in case they forget them during the trial. Alice is indignant at this and begins to shout, but is quickly silenced by the White Rabbit. The trial begins and the first witness is the Hatter. He comes in with a teacup and a piece of bread and butter. He explains that he was in the middle of his tea when he was summoned. The King is not pleased with this and scolds the Hatter. The Hatter then tells the court the date he believes the tarts were stolen. The March Hare and the Dormouse both give different dates. The King then orders the Hatter to take off his hat. The Hatter explains that it is not his hat, but the King does not believe him and the jury makes a note of it.  The Hatter is on trial for allegedly murdering the March Hare. The Queen is presiding over the trial, and the Hatter is the only witness. The Hatter is extremely nervous, and he fumbles his way through his testimony. At one point, he even bites a piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter. Alice is sitting in the courtroom, and she begins to grow larger again. The Dormouse, who is sitting next to her, complains that Alice is squishing him. Alice and the Dormouse argue back and forth for a bit, until finally the Dormouse crosses over to the other side of the courtroom. The Hatter's testimony continues, and he eventually gets to the part where the Dormouse said something. However, the Hatter can't remember what the Dormouse said, and the King gets angry. The Hatter is about to be executed, when one of the guinea-pigs in the courtroom cheers. The guinea-pig is immediately suppressed by the court officers. Alice is surprised by this, and she thinks to herself that she's glad she finally understands what "attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court" means. The Hatter is allowed to sit down, and the trial proceeds. However, the second guinea-pig in the courtroom cheers, and he too is suppressed. Eventually, the Hatter finishes his testimony and the trial is over. Alice is relieved, and she thinks to herself that now they can get on better.  Alice is called as a witness in the trial of the singers, and she testifies that she knows nothing about the case. The White Rabbit interrupts her, saying that she means "unimportant," of course. The King tells the jury to disregard the Rabbit's comment and to continue writing down Alice's testimony. However, the Lizard is so overcome with emotion that it can't write, and the Queen orders it to be removed from the courtroom.  Alice is on trial for a crime, and the jury is deliberating. The King asks them to consider their verdict carefully, as there is more evidence to come. The White Rabbit then presents a letter that he says was written by Alice.

RESPONSE:

Alice is on trial for a crime, and the jury is deliberating. The King asks them to consider their verdict carefully, as there is more evidence to come. The White Rabbit then presents a letter that he says was written by Alice. The letter is actually a set of verses, and it is not clear who the verses are addressed to. The jury is not sure what to make of the letter, and the White Rabbit says that Alice will have to explain it. However, Alice is nowhere to be found. The White Rabbit then reads out a note that Alice has left, saying that she has gone back to the beginning.
