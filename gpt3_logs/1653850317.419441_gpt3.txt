confusing.”  “It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.  “Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little queer, won’t you?”  “Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.  “Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know is, it would feel very queer to _me_.”  “You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are _you?_”  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_ short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”  “Why?” said the Caterpillar.  Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.  “Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something important to say!”  This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.  “Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.  “Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.  “No,” said the Caterpillar.  Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you think you’re changed, do you?”  “I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I used—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”  “Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.  “Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all came different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.  “Repeat, “_You are old, Father William_,’” said the Caterpillar.  Alice folded her hands, and began:—  “You are old, Father William,” the young man said,     “And your hair has become very white; And yet you incessantly stand on your head—     Do you think, at your age, it is right?”  “In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,     “I feared it might injure the brain; But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,     Why, I do it again and again.”  “You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,     And have grown most uncommonly fat; Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—     Pray, what is the reason of that?”  “In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,     “I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—     Allow me to sell you a couple?”  “You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak     For anything tougher than suet; Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—     Pray, how did you manage to do it?”  “In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,     And argued each case with my wife; And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,     Has lasted the rest of my life.”  “You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose     That your eye was as steady as ever; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—     What made you so awfully clever?”  “I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”     Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs! Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?     Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”   “That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.  “Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the words have got altered.”  “It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.  The Caterpillar was the first to speak.  “What size do you want to be?” it asked.  “Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one doesn’t like changing so often, you know.”  “I _don’t_ know,” said the Caterpillar.  Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Alice encounters a caterpillar and they begin speaking to one another. The caterpillar asks Alice why she is so confused and Alice responds by asking the caterpillar who it is. The caterpillar then asks Alice why she should tell her who it is and Alice doesn't have a good answer. The caterpillar tells Alice to keep her temper and Alice complies. The caterpillar then asks Alice if she has tried to say the alphabet and Alice says she has. The caterpillar tells Alice to recite a poem called "You are old, Father William" and Alice does so. The caterpillar criticizes Alice's recitation and tells her that she is wrong from beginning to end. The caterpillar then asks Alice what size she wants to be and Alice says she doesn't know. The caterpillar tells Alice that she will have to change sizes multiple times and Alice doesn't like that idea. The caterpillar then tells Alice that she will have to change again and Alice does so.
