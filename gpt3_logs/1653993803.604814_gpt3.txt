Write a concise summary of the following:

caterpillar tells her that she needs to eat a piece of the mushroom. Alice does not want to eat the mushroom, but she takes a small bite of it anyway. After she eats the mushroom, she grows very tall.  Alice encounters a caterpillar and they begin speaking to one another. The caterpillar asks Alice why she is so confused and Alice responds by asking the caterpillar who it is. The caterpillar then asks Alice why she should tell her who it is and Alice doesn't have a good answer. The caterpillar tells Alice to keep her temper and Alice complies. The caterpillar then asks Alice if she has tried to say the alphabet and Alice says she has. The caterpillar tells Alice to recite a poem called "You are old, Father William" and Alice does so. The caterpillar criticizes Alice's recitation and tells her that she is wrong from beginning to end. The caterpillar then asks Alice what size she wants to be and Alice says she doesn't know. The caterpillar tells Alice that she will have to change sizes multiple times and Alice doesn't like that idea. The caterpillar then tells Alice that she will have to change again and Alice does so.  Alice encounters a Caterpillar smoking a hookah on a mushroom and having a conversation. The Caterpillar tells Alice that she will grow taller on one side of the mushroom and shorter on the other. After a while, the Caterpillar disappears and Alice is left alone with the mushroom. Alice nibbles on the mushroom and suddenly her chin is struck by her own foot which she can no longer see. Alice continues to eat the mushroom and shrinks until her head is the only part of her body remaining. Suddenly, a pigeon appears and accuses Alice of being a serpent. Alice insists she is not a serpent, but the pigeon does not believe her. The pigeon goes on to say that Alice is just like all the other serpents who are difficult to please.  The Pigeon is sitting in its nest on top of a tree, when Alice comes by. The Pigeon is upset because Alice is disturbing its eggs, but Alice is confused because she doesn't see any eggs. The Pigeon explains that it is constantly on the lookout for serpents, which have been bothering it for the past three weeks. Alice is sympathetic, but the Pigeon doesn't believe her and accuses her of being a serpent in disguise. Alice insists that she is not a serpent, but the Pigeon doesn't believe her. The Pigeon finally tells Alice to go away and leave it alone. Alice walks away from the Pigeon and comes across a small house. She is curious to know who lives there, but is afraid of being seen. She decides to nibble on a piece of mushroom to shrink down to a smaller size. After she does this, she approaches the house and sees a footman in livery come out. The footman has a letter for the Duchess. Alice is curious to know what is going on, so she follows the footman.  Alice is walking in the woods when she comes across a Frog-Footman and a Fish-Footman. The Frog-Footman tells her that the Duchess has been invited to play croquet with the Queen, and the Fish-Footman says that the Queen has invited Alice to play as well. Both Footmen then bow, and their curls get tangled together. Alice laughs and runs away, but when she looks back, the Fish-Footman is gone and the Frog-Footman is sitting on the ground, staring up at the sky. Alice goes up to the door of the Duchess's house and knocks, but the Frog-Footman tells her that there's no use in knocking because he's on the same side of the door as she is and also because of the noise coming from inside the house. Alice can hear a lot of crashing and breaking inside, and she also hears the Duchess sneezing. The Frog-Footman tells Alice that she can do anything she likes, and he starts whistling. Alice goes into the house and finds the Duchess sitting in the middle of the kitchen, nursing a baby. The cook is at the stove, stirring a pot of soup, and there is a large cat sitting on the hearth, grinning. Alice asks the Duchess why the cat is grinning, and the Duchess tells her that it's a Cheshire cat and that's why. The Duchess then tells Alice that all cats can grin and most of them do.  Alice is sitting with the Duchess and the cook when the latter suddenly starts throwing things at the former. The Duchess does not react, and Alice is terrified that the baby will be hurt. The cook then tells Alice off for minding her own business, and the Duchess says that if everyone did that, the world would go round a lot faster. Alice tries to explain that this would not be an advantage, but the Duchess is not interested and starts singing a lullaby to the baby, shaking it violently. The cook then tells Alice she can nurse the baby if she likes, and throws a frying pan at the Duchess as she leaves. Alice manages to catch the baby and takes it outside. She is worried that if she leaves it with the Duchess and the cook, they will kill it, so she decides to take it with her.  Alice is talking to the Cheshire Cat, who has just told her that she is going to turn
