enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon; “but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”  “I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.  “And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”  “But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”  “Well! _What_ are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to invent something!”  “I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.  “A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never _one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!”  “I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.”  “I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”  This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”  “It matters a good deal to _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want _yours_: I don’t like them raw.”  “Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how _is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. “Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them _this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.     CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper   For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.  The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.”

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Pigeon is sitting in its nest on top of a tree, when Alice comes by. The Pigeon is upset because Alice is disturbing its eggs, but Alice is confused because she doesn't see any eggs. The Pigeon explains that it is constantly on the lookout for serpents, which have been bothering it for the past three weeks. Alice is sympathetic, but the Pigeon doesn't believe her and accuses her of being a serpent in disguise. Alice insists that she is not a serpent, but the Pigeon doesn't believe her. The Pigeon finally tells Alice to go away and leave it alone. Alice walks away from the Pigeon and comes across a small house. She is curious to know who lives there, but is afraid of being seen. She decides to nibble on a piece of mushroom to shrink down to a smaller size. After she does this, she approaches the house and sees a footman in livery come out. The footman has a letter for the Duchess. Alice is curious to know what is going on, so she follows the footman.
