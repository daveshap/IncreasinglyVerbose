eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say things are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?”  “Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t think—”  “Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.  “At any rate I’ll never go _there_ again!” said Alice as she picked her way through the wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!”  Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “But everything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.” And in she went.  Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_—she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.     CHAPTER VIII. The Queen’s Croquet-Ground   A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me like that!”  “I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my elbow.”  On which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the blame on others!”  “_You’d_ better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”  “What for?” said the one who had spoken first.  “That’s none of _your_ business, Two!” said Seven.  “Yes, it _is_ his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”  Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust things—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.  “Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are painting those roses?”  Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a _red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly

DETAILED SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

Alice encounters a group of gardeners who are painting roses red. They tell her that they are doing this because the Queen will be coming soon and they don't want her to know that they accidentally planted a white rose tree. Alice is curious and asks to see the Queen. The gardeners oblige and show her a group of ten soldiers, ten courtiers, and ten royal children, all of whom are decorated with hearts. The guests then come out, mostly elderly women. Finally, the Queen herself appears. She is a very large woman with a crown and a sceptre. She sits down and begins playing croquet with the guests. Alice is fascinated by the game and watches for a while. Soon, she gets bored and decided to leave. As she is leaving, she hears the Queen sentence the gardeners to death for their mistake. Alice is horrified and decides to speak up. She tells the Queen that she is being unfair and that the gardeners should be pardoned. The Queen is not happy with Alice's interference and orders her execution. Alice wakes up from her dream, relieved that it was all just a dream.
