hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d get the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!” But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.  Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. “That’s the judge,” she said to herself, “because of his great wig.”  The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.  “And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,” (she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, “jury-men” would have done just as well.  The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are they doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything to put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”  “They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply, “for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”  “Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the court!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.  Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell “stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.  One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.  “Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.  On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—  “The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,     All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,     And took them quite away!”   “Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.  “Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great deal to come before that!”  “Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”  The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, your Majesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.”  “You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?”  The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it was,” he said.  “Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.  “Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.  “Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.  “Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.  “It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.  “_Stolen!_” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.  “I keep

RESPONSE:

Alice is sitting in a courtroom, waiting for the trial to begin. She is curious about everything in the room and tries to guess what each thing is. She correctly identifies the judge and the jury box, but is unsure about what the twelve creatures in the jury box are. She eventually decides they must be the jurors. The jurors are all writing busily on their slates. Alice is curious about what they could be writing and asks the Gryphon. He tells her they are writing down their names in case they forget them during the trial. Alice is indignant at this and begins to shout, but is quickly silenced by the White Rabbit. The trial begins and the first witness is the Hatter. He comes in with a teacup and a piece of bread and butter. He explains that he was in the middle of his tea when he was summoned. The King is not pleased with this and scolds the Hatter. The Hatter then tells the court the date he believes the tarts were stolen. The March Hare and the Dormouse both give different dates. The King then orders the Hatter to take off his hat. The Hatter explains that it is not his hat, but the King does not believe him and the jury makes a note of it.
