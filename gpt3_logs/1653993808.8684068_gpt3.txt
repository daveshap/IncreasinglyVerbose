into a pig. Alice is not very pleased with this prospect, and wonders what she will do with the creature when she gets it home. The Cat then tells her about the Hatter and the March Hare, who both live nearby, and advises Alice to visit them if she wants to get somewhere. Alice decides to visit the March Hare, as she thinks he will be the most interesting, and perhaps not as mad as he was in March. On the way, she meets the Cat again, who asks her if she said 'pig' or 'fig'. Alice is not sure what he means, and the Cat disappears again. Alice eventually arrives at the March Hare's house, where she finds him and the Hatter having a tea party. The Hatter asks Alice a series of nonsensical questions, and she soon realizes that they are all mad. However, she enjoys the tea party and eventually leaves. As she is walking away, she meets the Cat again, who asks her if she knows the way to the Queen's croquet ground. Alice says she does not, and the Cat disappears once more.  Alice encounters a talking pig, who tells her to follow him. She does so, and he leads her to a large house. The pig then disappears and Alice is left alone. She approaches the house and is greeted by the March Hare and the Hatter, who invite her to have tea with them. The Dormouse is also present, fast asleep. Alice takes a seat and the March Hare offers her some wine. When Alice points out that there is no wine, the March Hare gets angry and tells her she should have known better than to sit down without being invited. The Hatter then tells Alice that her hair needs cutting. The conversation turns to riddles and the Hatter asks Alice why a raven is like a writing desk. Alice is unable to answer. The Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse then all take turns asking Alice impossible riddles. Frustrated, Alice stands up to leave, but is stopped by the Hatter, who asks her what day of the month it is. When Alice tells him, he informs her that she is two days off and that this is the reason his watch isn't working properly. The Hatter's watch begins ticking again and he, the March Hare, and the Dormouse all vanish.  Alice encounters the Hatter and the March Hare having tea. The Hatter is upset because the March Hare put the butter in the tea with the bread-knife, ruining the tea. Alice is curious about the Hatter's watch and comments on how it only tells the day of the month, to which the Hatter replies that Alice's watch probably doesn't tell the year. The Hatter and the March Hare begin to argue about time and Alice is confused. The Hatter explains that they keep time by having tea all the time and never washing the dishes. Alice is horrified by this and the Hatter tells her that it's all because Time is a murderer.  Alice, the March Hare, and the Hatter are sitting around a table drinking tea. The Hatter and the March Hare are getting tired of Alice, so they ask her to tell them a story. The Dormouse, who has been asleep the whole time, is woken up and also asked to tell a story. The Dormouse tells a story about three little sisters who live at the bottom of a well. They live on treacle and are very ill. Alice is confused by the story and asks questions. The Hatter and the March Hare get impatient with her and tell her to finish the story herself. Alice tries to finish the story, but she is not very good at it. The Hatter and the March Hare make fun of her and she gets angry. She tells them off and they all move to different seats around the table.  Alice encounters a group of gardeners who are painting roses red. They tell her that they are doing this because the Queen will be coming soon and they don't want her to know that they accidentally planted a white rose tree. Alice is curious and asks to see the Queen. The gardeners oblige and show her a group of ten soldiers, ten courtiers, and ten royal children, all of whom are decorated with hearts. The guests then come out, mostly elderly women. Finally, the Queen herself appears. She is a very large woman with a crown and a sceptre. She sits down and begins playing croquet with the guests. Alice is fascinated by the game and watches for a while. Soon, she gets bored and decided to leave. As she is leaving, she hears the Queen sentence the gardeners to death for their mistake. Alice is horrified and decides to speak up. She tells the Queen that she is being unfair and that the gardeners should be pardoned. The Queen is not happy with Alice's interference and orders her execution. Alice wakes up from her dream, relieved that it was all just a dream.  Alice is walking through a forest when she comes across a White Rabbit. The White Rabbit is talking to itself in a hurried, nervous manner and doesn't notice Alice. Alice then sees a Knave of Hearts carrying a King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion. Following the Knave is the King and Queen of Hearts. The Queen notices Alice and asks who she is. Alice introduces herself and the Queen asks Alice what she is doing there. Alice responds that she
