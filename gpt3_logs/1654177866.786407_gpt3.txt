REWRITTEN LONGER VERSION:

==========

RESPONSE:

Nihilism is bad because it is the belief that nothing matters and that life is meaningless. This leads to a feeling of despair and hopelessness, which can lead to suicide. Nihilism also leads to a lack of motivation and a sense of apathy. People who believe in nihilism may be less likely to take action to make positive changes in their lives or in the world.
