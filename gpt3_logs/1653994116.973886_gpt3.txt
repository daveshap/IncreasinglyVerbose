PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:

Alice falls down a rabbit hole and finds herself in a long, dark tunnel. She eventually comes to a small door and uses a key to unlock it. The door leads to a small passage, which Alice follows until she comes to a small room. The room is empty except for a table and a chair, and on the table is a small golden key. Alice pocketed the key and then explored the rest of the room, eventually finding a door that was too small for her to fit through. She tried the key in the lock and found that it fit, so she opened the door and squeezed through. Alice is in a dark hall, longing to get into a beautiful garden she can see through a doorway. She tries to get her head through the doorway, but she's too big. She wishes she could shrink like a telescope. Alice finds a key and a little bottle on a table. The bottle is labeled "DRINK ME," so Alice drinks some of the contents. Suddenly, she shrinks! She's now the right size to go through the doorway into the garden. First, she waits to see if she'll shrink any further. Then she goes into the garden and has a wonderful time. She eventually falls asleep. When Alice wakes up, she's back in the dark hall, and she's back to her original size. She can't find the key or the bottle. She starts to cry, but she scolds herself and decides to leave the dark hall. Alice sees something splashing about in the pool and swims over to investigate. She finds it is only a mouse that has slipped in like herself. Alice wonders if it would be any use to speak to the mouse, and decides to try. She begins by asking the mouse if it knows the way out of the pool. The mouse looks at her inquisitively but says nothing. Alice wonders if the mouse doesn't understand English, and decides it must be a French mouse that came over with William the Conqueror. She tries again, this time in French, but the mouse only leaps out of the water in fright. Alice apologizes, saying she forgot the mouse didn't like cats. The mouse responds angrily, saying that its family has always hated cats. Alice hurriedly changes the subject, asking if the mouse is fond of dogs. The mouse doesn't answer, so Alice continues, telling the mouse about a nice little dog near her house. The mouse swims away in anger and Alice calls after it, promising not to talk about cats or dogs if the mouse comes back. The mouse swims back and agrees to tell Alice its story. The story turns out to be quite long, and by the time the mouse is finished, the pool is quite full of animals that have fallen in. Alice leads the way out and the whole party swims to shore. Alice and the other animals are sitting on the bank, wet and uncomfortable. They discuss how to get dry again and Alice finds herself talking to them as if she has known them all her life. The Mouse, who seems to be in charge, tells them to sit down and be quiet while it dries them off. The Mouse starts reciting a long history, but the Lory interrupts, shivering. The Mouse scolds the Lory and continues reciting. The Duck interrupts, asking what the Mouse is talking about.  Alice meets a group of animals and birds who are planning to burn down a house. She tries to escape and ends up shrinking in size. She meets a puppy who is friendly but she is afraid it will eat her. She also meets a caterpillar who tells her she needs to eat or drink something. She doesn't see anything that she should eat or drink so she looks over the edge of a mushroom and sees the caterpillar.  Alice encounters a caterpillar and a pigeon while on a journey through the woods. The caterpillar tells Alice she will need to change sizes multiple times and the pigeon accuses Alice of being a serpent. Alice insists she is not a serpent, but the pigeon doesn't believe her. The Pigeon finally tells Alice to go away and leave it alone. Alice comes across a small house and decides to nibble on a piece of mushroom to shrink down to a smaller size. After she does this, she approaches the house and sees a footman in livery come out. Alice is curious to know what is going on, so she follows the footman. Alice is walking in the woods when she comes across a Frog-Footman and a Fish-Footman. The Frog-Footman tells her that the Duchess has been invited to play croquet with the Queen, and the Fish-Footman says that the Queen has invited Alice to play as well. Both Footmen then bow, and their curls get tangled together. Alice laughs and runs away, but when she looks back, the Fish-Footman is gone and the Frog-Footman is sitting on the ground, staring up at the sky. Alice goes up to the door of the Duchess's house and knocks, but the Frog-Footman tells her that there's no use in knocking because he's on the same side of the door as she is and also because of the noise coming from inside the house. Alice can hear a lot of crashing and breaking inside, and she also hears the Duchess sneezing. The Frog-Footman tells Alice that she can do anything she likes, and he starts whistling. Alice goes into the house and finds the Duchess sitting in

Alice falls into a rabbit hole and finds herself in a dark tunnel. She eventually comes to a small door which she unlocks with a key. This leads her to a small room which contains a table with a small golden key on it. Alice pocketed the key and explored the room, finding a door that was too small for her to fit through.
