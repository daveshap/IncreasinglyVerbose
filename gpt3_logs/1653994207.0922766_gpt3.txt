Write a concise summary of the following:

Alice falls into a rabbit hole and finds herself in a dark tunnel. She eventually comes to a small door which she unlocks with a key. This leads her to a small room which contains a table with a small golden key on it. Alice pocketed the key and explored the room, finding a door that was too small for her to fit through. However, she shrinks after drinking from a bottle labelled "DRINK ME" and is able to fit through the door. She finds herself in a dark hall with a doorway to a beautiful garden. After unsuccessfully trying to get through the doorway, Alice finds a key and a little bottle on a table. The bottle is labelled "DRINK ME," so Alice drinks some of the contents and shrinks. She's now the right size to go through the doorway into the garden. First, she waits to see if she'll shrink any further. Then she goes into the garden and has a wonderful time. She eventually falls asleep. When Alice wakes up, she's back in the dark hall, and she's back to her original size. She can't find the key or the bottle. She starts to cry, but she scolds herself and decides to leave the dark hall. Alice sees something splashing about in the pool and swims over to investigate. She finds it is only a mouse that has slipped in like herself. Alice wonders if it would be any use to speak to the mouse, and decides to try. The mouse tells Alice its story and the story of all the animals who have fallen into the pool. Alice leads the way out and the whole party swims to shore. The Mouse starts reciting a long history, but the Lory interrupts, shivering. The Mouse scolds the Lory and continues reciting. The Duck interrupts, asking what the Mouse is talking about. Alice meets a group of animals and birds who are planning to burn down a house. She tries to escape and ends up shrinking in size. She meets a puppy who is friendly but she is afraid it will eat her. She also meets a caterpillar who tells her she needs to eat or drink something. She doesn't see anything that she should eat or drink so she looks over the edge of a mushroom and sees the caterpillar. Alice encounters a caterpillar and a pigeon while on a journey through the woods. The caterpillar tells Alice she will need to change sizes multiple times and the pigeon accuses Alice of being a serpent. Alice insists she is not a serpent, but the pigeon doesn't believe her. The Pigeon finally tells Alice to go away and leave it alone. Alice comes across a small house and decides to nibble on a piece of mushroom to shrink down to a smaller size. After she does this, she approaches the house and sees a footman in livery come out. Alice is curious to know what is going on, so she follows the footman. Alice is walking in the woods when she comes across a Frog-Footman and a Fish-Footman. The Frog-Footman tells her that the Duchess has been invited to play croquet with the Queen, and the Fish-Footman says that the Queen has invited Alice to play as well. Both Footmen then bow, and their curls get tangled together. Alice laughs and runs away, but when she looks back, the Fish-Footman is gone and the Frog-Footman is sitting on the ground, staring up at the sky. Alice goes up to the door of the Duchess's house and knocks, but the Frog-Footman tells her that there's no use in knocking because he's on the same side of the door as she is and also because of the noise coming from inside the house. Alice can hear a lot of crashing and breaking inside, and she also hears the Duchess sneezing. The Frog-Footman tells Alice that she can do anything she likes, and he starts whistling. Alice goes into the house and finds the Duchess sitting in  Alice falls down a rabbit hole and finds herself in Wonderland, where she has a series of adventures.
