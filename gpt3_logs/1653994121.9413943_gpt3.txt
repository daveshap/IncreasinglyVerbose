the middle of the kitchen, nursing a baby. The cook is at the stove, stirring a pot of soup, and there is a large cat sitting on the hearth, grinning. Alice asks the Duchess why the cat is grinning, and the Duchess tells her that it's a Cheshire cat and that's why. The Duchess then tells Alice that all cats can grin and most of them do. Alice is sitting with the Duchess and the cook when the latter suddenly starts throwing things at the former. The Duchess does not react, and Alice is terrified that the baby will be hurt. The cook then tells Alice off for minding her own business, and the Duchess says that if everyone did that, the world would go round a lot faster. Alice tries to explain that this would not be an advantage, but the Duchess is not interested and starts singing a lullaby to the baby, shaking it violently. The cook then tells Alice she can nurse the baby if she likes, and throws a frying pan at the Duchess as she leaves. Alice manages to catch the baby and takes it outside. She is worried that if she leaves it with the Duchess and the cook, they will kill it, so she decides to take it with her. Alice is talking to the Cheshire Cat, who has just told her that she is going to turn  Alice encounters a talking pig, who leads her to a large house where she meets the March Hare and the Hatter. They invite her to have tea with them and the conversation turns to riddles. Alice is unable to answer the riddles and the Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse all vanish. Alice is then left alone in the house.  Alice is summoned by the Queen to settle an argument between the executioner and the King and Queen about whether or not it is possible to behead something without a body. Alice suggests they ask the Duchess, who is in prison. The executioner goes to fetch her, and while he is gone, the Cat's head disappears. The Duchess is in a good mood when she returns, and she and Alice walk off together. Alice reflects on how the Duchess was so savage when they first met in the kitchen, and wonders if it was the pepper that made her that way. The Duchess begins telling Alice a story about a Mock Turtle. Alice is playing croquet with the Queen when she is suddenly summoned to speak with her. The Queen is very angry and tells Alice that she must either leave or be put to death. Alice chooses to leave, and the Queen tells her to go see the Mock Turtle. Alice meets the Gryphon, who tells her that the Mock Turtle is very sad and has been crying. They go to see him and the Gryphon tells Alice that the Mock Turtle will tell her his story. The Mock Turtle tells Alice that he used to be a real turtle, but he is now just a mock turtle. He tells her about his life and how he became a mock turtle. Alice is very sympathetic and feels sorry for the Mock Turtle. She is also glad when the Gryphon tells her that executions are not really carried out in their world. The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon are telling Alice about their schooling. The Mock Turtle explains that they went to school in the sea and that the master was an old Turtle called Tortoise. Alice is surprised that they would call him Tortoise if he wasn't one. The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon explain that he was called Tortoise because he taught them. They tell Alice that they had the best education and that they learned French and music. The Mock Turtle says that they also learned washing, but Alice is surprised that they would need to learn that at the bottom of the sea. The Mock Turtle explains that they couldn't afford to learn it. They tell Alice about the different subjects they learned, including reeling and writhing, arithmetic, and drawling. They also tell her about the Mystery and Seaography classes. When Alice asks about the eleventh day, the Mock Turtle tells her that it was a holiday. The Lobster Quadrille is a dance performed by two lines of people, with each person having a lobster as their partner. The dance starts with everyone advancing twice and then changing partners. The new partners then swim out to sea as far as they can and back to land again. The dance ends with everyone changing partners again and retiring in the same order.  Alice is on trial for a crime, and the jury is deliberating. The King asks them to consider their verdict carefully, as there is more evidence to come. The White Rabbit then presents a letter that he says was written by Alice. The letter is actually a set of verses, and it is not clear who the verses are addressed to. The jury is not sure what to make of the letter, and the White Rabbit says that Alice will have to explain it. However, Alice is nowhere to be found. The White Rabbit then reads out a note that Alice has left, saying that she has gone back to the beginning.  Alice is sitting on a riverbank with her sister when she notices a white rabbit running by. She follows the rabbit down a hole, and finds herself in Wonderland. She has a series of adventures, meeting peculiar creatures like the Mad Hatter, the March
