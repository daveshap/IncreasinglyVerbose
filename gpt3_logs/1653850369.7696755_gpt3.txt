said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”  “All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.  “Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”  She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”     CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party   There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep, I suppose it doesn’t mind.”  The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw Alice coming. “There’s _plenty_ of room!” said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.  “Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.  Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. “I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.  “There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.  “Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.  “It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said the March Hare.  “I didn’t know it was _your_ table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great many more than three.”  “Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.  “You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some severity; “it’s very rude.”  The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_ was, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”  “Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.  “Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said the March Hare.  “Exactly so,” said Alice.  “Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.  “I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I say—that’s the same thing, you know.”  “Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might just as well say that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”  “You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what I get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”  “You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing as ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”  “It _is_ the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn’t much.  The Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month is it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.  Alice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”  “Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn’t suit the works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.  “It was the _best_

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Alice encounters a talking pig, who tells her to follow him. She does so, and he leads her to a large house. The pig then disappears and Alice is left alone. She approaches the house and is greeted by the March Hare and the Hatter, who invite her to have tea with them. The Dormouse is also present, fast asleep. Alice takes a seat and the March Hare offers her some wine. When Alice points out that there is no wine, the March Hare gets angry and tells her she should have known better than to sit down without being invited. The Hatter then tells Alice that her hair needs cutting. The conversation turns to riddles and the Hatter asks Alice why a raven is like a writing desk. Alice is unable to answer. The Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse then all take turns asking Alice impossible riddles. Frustrated, Alice stands up to leave, but is stopped by the Hatter, who asks her what day of the month it is. When Alice tells him, he informs her that she is two days off and that this is the reason his watch isn't working properly. The Hatter's watch begins ticking again and he, the March Hare, and the Dormouse all vanish.
